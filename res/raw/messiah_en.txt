_
But they are free to believe they can, and they may fear if they wish.
_
Most happy, successful people at one time have considered suicide. They decided against it.
_
You are free to create and honor whatever past you choose, to heal and transform your present.
_
Your harshest truths are dreams, and your gentlest dreams are true.
_
Everything is exactly as it is for a reason. The crumb on your table is no mystical reminder of this morning’s cookie, it is there because you have chosen not to remove it.
_
No Exeeptions.
_
Just because somebody drops in on you from another dimension, don’t assume they’re wiser than you about anything at all, or that they can do anything better than you can do it yourself. Discarnate or mortal, what matters about people is what they know.
_
Everybody came here with a Design-O-Life Personal Future Construction Kit. Not everybody remembers where they put it.
_
Life tells you nothing, it shows you everything.
_
You’ve all learned something that someone somewhere needs to remember.
_
How will you Let them know?
_
Lean into your, fears, dare them to do their worst and cut them down when they try. If you don’t, they’ll clone themselves, mushroom till they surround you, choke the road to the life you want.
_
Every turn you fear is empty air, dressed to look like jagged hell.
_
Over and again you’ll meet a new theology, and every time will come the test: Do I take this belief to become my life?
_
If God looked directly into your eyes and said, “I command that you be happy in the world, as long as you live,” What would you do?
_
It’s called a default belief, when you agree to rules before you think, when you go along because you’re expected to. A million of those in a lifetime unless you’re careful.

_
Lfe does, however, require you to feel the consequences of your choises.
_
What if all these levels inside you are your friends, and they know a lot more than you know? What if your teachers are here, right now? Instead of always talking, what if for a change you listen?
_
Anger is always fear, and fear is always fear of loss.
_
Remember that this world is not reality. It’s a playground of appearances on which you practice overcoming seems-to-be with your knowing of what is.
_
Want a trouble-free future? Why did you show up in spacetime if you didn’t want trouble?
_
The less you know about the game, and the less you remember you’re a player, the more senseless living becomes.
_
If one inspired innocent loving soaring dreamer believes in a universe of joy and light and perfect being, and if she’s wrong and dies, it’s not the dreamer who’s been foolish, but the universe.
_
There’s a reason you chose what’s happening around you.
_
Hang On.
_
Live your way through the best you know, and in a bit you’ll find out why.

The highest nation is a structure of values, and its patriotism is conscience.
_
Every turn in your life, every time you decide, you become parent to all your alternate selves who follow.
_
Any powerful idea is absolutely fascinating and absolutely useless until you decide to put it to work.
_
When you seek inspiration, it’s ideas you want. When you pray for guidance, it’s ideas that show the way. But you have to pay attention!
_
Pretend that you honestly truly deeply want to know who you are, where you came from, and why you’re here. Pretend you’re willing never to rest till you know.
_
Now: Can you imagine yourself not finding out?
_
“Bad” is that which makes you unhappy. “Evil” is that which makes you very unhappy.
_
Your philosophy is a way of looking at the universe that guides you in daily life. You probably won’t find it in textbooks.
_
The biggest reason you don’t get answers is that you haven’t asked the questions.
_
When you pull a propeller through compression, don’t be surprised when the engine starts.
_
Whatever you decide to live, you’ll live not once but a thousand times over, remembering for the rest of your life.
_
Guilt is the tension you feel to change your past, present, or future for someone else’s sake. It’s your tension, you can let it go.
_
You know nothing till intuition agrees.
_
When you dream, all the scenery, characters, events, perils, and outcomes are built from your own consciousness, the darks and oppressions as well as the delights. Same with the world awake, though it takes you longer to build it.
_
Shop for security over happiness and you buy it, at that price.
_
How many live lifetimes without finding what they know and love? Many. It’s your job to be sure you’re not one of ‘em.
_
When the ship of your spirit hits the reef of matter, it’s the reef that’s smashed to pieces.
_

_
Your depth of intimacy with another is inversely proportional to the number of others in your life.

It’s okay to do ordinary, so long as you don’t feel ordinary.
_
Having climbed certain peaks you’ll descend no more, but spread your wings and fly beyond.
_
What’s going to happen has already happened.
_
What you perceive is up to you.
_
You will never grow up.
_
Why do you think you’re odd and different, a lonely outsider, when all that’s happened is you haven’t found your family?
_
With every choice you risk the life you would have had; with every decision, you lose it.
_
You build your personal world calm or wild according to what you wish. You can weave peace in the midst of chaos, you can destroy in the midst of paradise. Depends on how you shape your spirit.
_
Find the greatest teachers, ask the hardest questions, they never say, “Study philosophy,” or, “Get your degree.” They say, “You already know.”
_
It’s a slow process, changing principles, and you’ll never know they’ve changed until something that used to be right just doesn’t feel that way any more.
_
Unconditional love is no more a force in spacetime than it is in chess, or soccer or ice hockey. Rules define life in games, and unconditional love doesn’t recognize rules.
_
Forgetting is what people on this planet call “consciousness.”
_
The smallest turn today will take you to a dramatically different tomorrow.
_
What you knew before you were born isn’t lost. You only hide it till you’re tested, till it’s time to remember. And sure enough, when you want, you’ll find some odd funny beautiful way to find it again.
_
You chose us for your teachers? We chose you, too! You care about what you’re learning? We care, too! You think we’re in your life because you love us? Can’t you understand? We love you, too!
_
Can miles truly separate friends? If you want to be with one that you love, aren’t you already there?
_
Forget about faith. You don’t need faith to fly, you need to understand flying.
_
When you learn what this world is, how it works, you automatically start getting miracles... what others will call miracles.
_
You are the game-playing, fun-having creatures; you are the otters of the universe.
_
Spacetime is a fairly primitive school. But a lot of folks stay with the belief of it even when it’s boring, and they don’t want the lights turned on early.
_
Like attract like Be who you are, calm and clear and bright, asking yourself every minute is this what I really want to do, doing it only when you answer yes. This turns away those who have nothing to learn from who you are and attracts those who do, and from whom you have to learn as well.
_
“Just your imagination?” Of course it’s your imagination! This world is your imagination. Have you forgotten?
_
You do not exist to impress the world. You exist to live your life in a way that will make you happy.
_
Any different spacetime is a dream for a good sane earthling, which you are going to be for a little while yet.
_
How many lives on the planet? How many lives in the universe? One
_
There are grand rewards for those who pick the high hard roads, but those rewards are hidden by years. Every choice is made in the uncaring blind, no guarantees from the world around you.
_
No matter how qualified or deserving you are, you will never reach a better life until you can imagine it for yourself, and allow yourself to have it.
_
You build the appearances around you. You get exactly what you deserve. Who’s to blame, who’s to credit, but you? Who can change it, any time you wish, but you.
_
Y our only obligation in any lifetime is to be true to yourself.
_
Is this my highest sense of right? Is this the direction I want most to go? Is this the way in which I can give my greatest gift?
_
There aren’t just a few of you scattered through the land who are creatures of light and everyone else is a lump of clay. You’re all light-beings.
_
Reality has nothing to do with appearances, with your narrow way of seeing.
_
Reality is love expressed, pure perfect love, unbrushed by space and time.
_
As you’re one with the person you were a second ago or a week ago, as you’re one with the person you’re going to be a moment from now or a week from now, So you’re one with the person you were a lifetime ago, the one you are in an alternate lifetime, the one you’ll be a hundred lifetimes into what you call your future.
_
The choice to follow any real adventure is measured by this view: When you look back on it, will you be glad you dared, or glad you didn’t?
_
To love someone unconditionally is not to care who they are or what they do. Unconditional love, on the surface, looks the same as indifference.
_
Hatred is love without the facts. Why tell lies to separate and destroy yourselves when the truth is you’re one?
_
You have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing can stand in your way.
_
No one does anything uncharacteristic of who they are.
_
From time to time it’s fun to close your eyes, and in that dark say to yourself, ‘I am the sorcerer, and when I open my eyes I shall see a world that I have created, and for which I and only I am completely responsible.” Slowly then, eyelids open like curtains lifting stage-center. And sure enough, there’s your world just the way you built it.
_
Whoever wants truth and light will find it for themselves.
_
When you look back on your days, they’ve passed in a flash. Time doesn’t last, and nobody here’s got long to live.
_
The only thing that shatters dreams is compromise.
_
How easy it is to be compassionate when it’s yourself you see in trouble!
_
C are about understanding and before you know it, in just a few decades, you’ll have a system of thinking that gives you answers whenever you ask.
_
You are fiction to the selves who took other paths and choices. They are fiction to you. You’ve got a lot to learn from each other.
_
To learn anything, you must put aside the safety of your ignorance.
_
You wait a lifetime to meet Someone who understands you, accepts you as you are. At the end, you find that Someone, all along, has been you.
_
How do you want to come out of this experience — how do you want to be changed because of it?
_
No one forces you to learn. You’ll learn when you want to.
_
A fledgling leaps because it trusts its wings; a lemming leaps because everybody else is doing it. One’s an adventure into new dimensions, the other’s suicide.
_
Why bother to live an unhappy life?
_
The individual is always the exception.
_
“Everybody can’t….. ” but anybody can.
_
It’s easy to live the expected and conventional. It’s when you live the unexpected that you start having fun with your life.
_
What many take for realistic is the suppression of their deepest knowing. Why be realistire?
_
Before you’ll change, something important must be at risk.
_
If you don’t want to be a teacher, you’d better get off the planet.
_
A creative mind makes uncommon connections. So does a crazy mind.
_
A creative mind maker uncommon insightful connections.
_
You build lifetimes as spiders build webs. Lots of trials, sometimes, to fit one strand.
_
Every event is subjective: not what it means, that matters, but what it means to you.
_
Time cares about Becoming Reality cares about Is.
_
There’s nothing to forgive when you know you’ve gathered to yourself all of your own experiences. Why frown at those who bring what you’ve asked?
_
You can tell a lot about a person when you know what gives them comfort.
_
You learn most when you play against an opponent who can beat you.
_
Hope knows that a lovely thing is true before it shows up on her doorstep.
_
You’re master of what you’ve lived, artisan at what you’re living, amateur at what’s next to live.
_
Find your strength and you become a center of pressure that moves your time.
_
When you live by the highest you know, the outcome of the game doesn’t matter. However it comes out, it came out right.
_
Even when you’re brought together by miraculous magnetizing, you still have to work out problems.
_
Even when you’re brought together by miraculous magnetizing, you still have to work out problems.
_
That which most concerns and worries you — your survival — is the only certainty you have.
_
You adjust your perceptions to a certain frequency, and call what you see “this world.” You can tune yourself to other frequencies whenever you wish.
_
The creative, loving-something life is also the healthy one. There is healing and protection in doing what makes you happy.
_
The first step in de-hypnotizing yourself is to realize that you’ve been hypnotized in the first place.
_
No heavens, no hells, just these endless worlds you create till you think you’ve got it right.
_
It’s there, that certificate, in everybody’s pocket.
_
There is nothing to which you cannot give your consent, there is nothing from which you cannot withdraw it.
_
Guarantee for a difficult and happy lifetime: Find what you love to do more than anything else in all the world. Do it, no matter what stands in your way. Give the gifts of what you’ve learned from that love to others who care enough to ask.
_
Is it real. Yes, if: it always has been, it always will be, and, it exists in and beyond every corner of every alternate universe.
_

_
Learn what the magician knows and it’s not magic anymore.
_
You may not be aware, but you know.
_
Whatever harm you would do to another, do first to yourself.
_
Live enough of what you’ve always dreamed of doing, and there’s no room left for feeling bad.
_
Don’t pray to get God’s attention to fix some wrong. Pray to get your own attention, and realize that nothing needs fixing.
_
Your mission is the luminous path that you follow, no matter how dark the night around you.
_
To any question, imagine the most outlandish opposite of the expected answer. Is that one true?
_
Some say suffer, some say serve, some say detach.
_
Who says find your highest right for yourself?
_
There’s nothing here but perfect. Perfect expression of perfect life: can’t be changed, no different truth.
_
Dying out of bodies, remember, is as much a dream as living in them.
_
Learning is finding out what you already know Darning is finding out what you already know. Doing is demonstrating that you know it. Teaching is reminding others that they know just as well as you. You are all learners, doers, teachers.
_
Not being known doesn’t stop the truth from being true.
_
You are free to smile in the midst of massive tests and challenges, knowing that you have chosen to play this game, and that you have dominion over all the appearances of earth.
_
The simplest questions are the most profound. Where were you born? Where is you home? Where are you going? What are you doing? Think about these once in a while, and watch your answers change.
_
Mortalhood is a fine state to visit, but you’d better not call it home.
_
Every person, all the events of your life are there because you have drawn them there. What you choose to do with them is up to you.
_
If it’s got atoms, it isn’t real.
_
You teach best what you most need to learn.
_
Live never to be ashamed if anything you do or say is published around the world — even if what is published is not true.
_
Your friends will know you better in the first minute you meet than your acquaintances will know you in a thousand years.
_
The Is is Life, Love, the Magnificent IT at the center of your being. The Is does not recognize the limitations of spacetime, nor does it recognize your sorrows, fears, or beliefs. It does not see you as an upright biped on the surface of a third planet from a little sun at the edge of a small galaxy of an insignificant universe sandwiched for a moment between multiple trillions of other universes. It sees you reflecting Itself, and allows you the absolute freedom to do anything you wish, except to die.
_
To bring anything into your life, imagine that it’s already there.
_
Disaster is change. It’s opportunity in a loose-fitting, hooded garment.
_
The best way to avoid responsibility is to say, “I’ve got responsibilities.”
_
Listen to your answers even when they’re mad, so long as they’re your highest truth.
_
You are free to change your level of consciousness by whim, learning, or design. You are not free to stop expressing life.
_
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other’s life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof.
_
You are led through your lifetime by the inner learning creature, the playful spiritual being that is your real self. Don’t turn away from possible futures before you’re certain you don’t have anything to learn from them. You’re always free to change your mind and choose a different future, or a different past.
_
Argue for your limitations, and sure enough, they’re yours.
_
It is easy to forget your times of knowing, to think they’ve been dreams or old miracles, one time. Nothing good is a miracle, nothing lovely is a dream.
_
Don’t believe what your eyes are telling you. All they show is limitation. Look with your understanding, find out what you already know, and you’ll see the way to fly.
_
There’s no disaster that can’t become a blessing, and no blessing that can’t become a disaster.
_
The world is your exercise-book, the pages on which you do your sums. It is not reality, although you can express reality there if you wish. You are also free to write nonsense, or lies, or to tear the pages.
_
Listen to your life. It’s showing you everything you need to know about who you can become.
_
The original sin is to limit the Is. Don’t.
_
Your character grows from following your highest sense of right, from trusting ideals without being sure they’ll work.
_
There is no such thing as a problem without a gift for you in its hands. You seek problems because you need their gifts.
_
One challenge of your adventure on earth is to rise above dead systems: wars, religions, nations, destructions — to refuse to be a part of them, and express instead the highest self you know how to be.
_
A cloud does not know why it moves in just such a direction and at such a speed. It feels an impulsion... This is the place to go now. But the sky knows the reasons and the patterns behind all clouds, and you will know, too, when you lift yourself high enough to see beyond horizons.
_
If you will practice being fictional for a while, you will understand that fictional characters are sometimes more real than people with bodies and heartbeats.
_
Your conscience is the measure of the honesty of your selfishness. Listen to it carefully.
_
The truth you speak has no past and no future. It is, and that’s all it needs to be.
_
Destiny doesn’t push you where you don’t want to go. You’re the one who chooses. Destiny’s up to you.
_
You ate a creature of light. From light have you come, to light shall you go, and surrounding you through every step is the light of your infinite being.
_
Imagine the universe beautiful and just and perfect. Then be sure of one thing: The Is has imagined it quite a bit better than you have.
_
Do unto others as you truly feel like doing unto others.
_
What you see is your own consciousness. When that’s lifted up, how your scenes do change!
_
Here’s a test to find whether your mission on earth is finished: If you’re alive, it isn’t.
_
A void problems And you’ll never be the one who overcame them.
_
Don’t be dismayed at good-byes. A farewell is necessary before you can meet again. And meeting again, after moments or lifetimes, is certain for those who are friends.
_
You have the power to do anything you wish except these two: You cannot create reality. You cannot destroy it.
_
When will you learn to expect what you can’t imagine will happen?
_
You are never given a wish without also being given the power to make it true. You may have to work for it, however.
_
How others deal with gifts you’ve given is not your decision, but theirs.
_
You don’t have to know what’s waiting. You’re guided by your highest right, and wherever it takes you is where you need to go.
_
Sometimes you’d best keep quiet about what you know. Fast as light within, but outside, let’s take her one step at a time.
_
Your religion is your way of finding what is true.
_
The only thing that matters, at the end of a stay on earth, is How well did you love? What was the quality of your love?
_
There are no mistakes. The events you bring upon yourself, no matter how unpleasant, are necessary in order to learn what you need to learn. Whatever step you take, It’s necessary to reach the place you’ve chosen to go.
_
You gave your lire to become the person you are right now. Was it worth it?
_
Life is That’s where you go for healing, comfort, energy, perspective.
_
One way to pick a future is to believe it’s inevitable.
_
To name a thing is harmless. To name ideas is to create a religion. Don’t you dare!
_
You’ve held to your sense of right, your inner ethics, even when it’s been hard or dangerous or when others call you strange. That strangeness sets you apart; it makes you lonely. What are you going to do about that?
_
The Is doesn’t need you to tell anybody how it works.
_
The mark of your ignorance is the depth of your belief in injustice and tragedy. What the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the master calls a butterfly.
_
You are all. Free. To do. Whatever. You want. To do.
_
In order to live free and happily, you must sacrifice boredom. It is not always an easy sacrifice.
_
Whatever inspires, also guides and protects.
_
Know that ever about you stands the reality of love, and each moment you have the power to transform your world by what you have learned.
_
Your oneness in love is reality, and mirages cannot change reality. Don’t forget. No matter what seems to be.
_
Believe you know all answers, and you know all answers. Believe you’re a master and you are one.
_
No one can solve problems for someone whose problem is that they don’t want their problems solved.
_
You don’t have to fight to live as you wish. Live as you wish and pay whatever price is required.
_
You do not create your own reality. You create your own appearances. Big differences!
_
Any principle that requires admiration isn’t real. Any God who requires worship doesn’t exist.
_
Who you are is someone who asked to be dropped off on earth so you could do something remarkable, something that matters to you, which you could not do anywhere, anywhen else.
_
The only way to win, sometimes, is to surrender.
_
Sacrifice is giving up something you want for something you don’t want. It is never required.
_
Take your dying with some seriousness. To be delighted on the way to your death is not generally understood by less-advanced life-forms, and they’ll call you crazy.
_
Everything in this book may be wrong.
